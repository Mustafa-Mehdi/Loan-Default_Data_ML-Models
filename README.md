# 🏦 Loan Default Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This project aims to build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of a customer defaulting on a loan. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the goal is to help financial institutions minimize credit risk and make data-driven lending decisions.

---

## 📁 File
- `ML_Project_Loan_Default_data.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the entire machine learning workflow.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- The dataset includes various borrower attributes such as credit score, income, employment status, loan amount, and repayment history.
- Target variable: `Loan Default` (Binary classification: Default / No Default)

---

## ⚙️ Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizations to understand distributions and correlations
   - Insights into default trends

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Selection of relevant predictors
   - Transformation of skewed data

4. **Model Building**
   - Models used: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.
   - Train-test split for validation

5. **Evaluation**
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
   - Model comparison and selection

## 🧠 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Google Colab
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## ✅ Outcome
A trained classification model capable of identifying high-risk loan applicants with reasonable accuracy and interpretability.
